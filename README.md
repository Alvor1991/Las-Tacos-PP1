## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

* Showcase Mexican cuisine - highlight the rich and diverse flavors of Mexican cuisine through engaging visuals and descriptions.

### Color Scheme
![Color scheme image](assets/readme-files/colour-scheme.png)

The colors used in the site are red (#784742), yellow (#E5B87B), two shades of green (#56733C and #FAFCF7) and the colour white for the main background. These colours represent Cinco de Mayo, a celebration of Mexico. I recreated the Mexican flag in the navigation bar and footer elements. A shade of gold is used instead of white, as I wanted the colour to stand out more against a light clean background. For the menu section, the left side is red and the right side is green, consistent with the Las Tacos logo. The desserts heading is in gold to give the menu the complete colour selection and highlight desserts as an indulgent and luxury item.

### Typography

I want the site to have both an authentic and modern feel. Amatic SC is used for the headings, which gives the site a friendly and informal vibe. It evokes a sense of traditional Mexican art, adding a touch of authenticity to the site. It is also used for the logo, reinforcing the Las Tacos brand. The main font used in the site is Lato, with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case Lato is not being imported correctly. The combination of Amatic SC and Lato creates a cohesive visual identity. 

### Wireframes

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) has been used to showcase the appearance of the site and display the placement of the different elements whitin the pages.
